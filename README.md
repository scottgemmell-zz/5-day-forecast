# 5-day-forecast
A weather forecast app _by Scott Gemmell_

## Guide
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).<br>
You can find the most recent version of this guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## How to build / run / test project

```javascript
npm install 
yarn install 
```
```javascript
npm start 
yarn start 
```
```javascript
npm test 
yarn test 
```

## What could be done with more time
* Tests. Event and Redux based.
* Refactor Error scenarios. Consider a `<ForecastsNoResults />` component.
* Do not show _"Please enter a City and a Country"_ on load.
* Use icons provided by OpenWeather API (only just noticed they are available).
* Use Routes to show a more detailed information page.
